# E-Commerce API Rate Limiting Middleware

This project implements a Redis-based rate limiting middleware for an Express.js API with Kafka logging for excessive requests. It's suitable for APIs in e-commerce or other environments.

## Features

- This limits requests in fixed windows (e.g. 15 mins from first request) â€” not sliding windows. ( Sliding window considers last 15 mins from now )
- Per-user request tracking (IP-based)
- Configurable rate limits (defaults are 100 requests per 15 minutes) - can be set in .env file
- Logs excessive requests to Kafka
- Dockerized setup with Redis, Kafka, Zookeeper, and Node.js
- easy setup, just run run.sh
